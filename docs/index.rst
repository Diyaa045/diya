Datasette
=========

*A tool for exploring and publishing data*

Datasette is a tool for exploring and publishing data. It helps people take data of any shape or size and publish that as an interactive, explorable website and accompanying API.

Datasette is aimed at data journalists, museum curators, archivists, local governments and anyone else who has data that they wish to share with the world. It is part of a :ref:`wider ecosystem of tools <ecosystem>` dedicated to make working with structured data as productive as possible.
